          <p>Nono dating is a social experiment that started with an idea that there should be no discrimination.
            We remove images from the equation and allow you to focus on one another's story. It's all text.</p>

      <h2>No fine print</h2>
      <p><strong>Free but be safe.</strong></p>
        <p>Seems legit. It's a dating club. Free social experiment. Other than this it's common sense:
          be nice and you will have a wonderful sustained dating experience throughout your membership.
        Be a neanderthal and you get quickly booted from a good thing.</p>
      <p>Cancellation is easy, just send us a message from within the interface that you would like to do so.</p>
